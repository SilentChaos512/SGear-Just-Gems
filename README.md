# Just Gems

A material pack for [Silent Gear](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear) adding some main parts for various gemstones. This is intended for players who do not want to use Silent's Gems, but still want gem tools. Should be compatible with any gem mod that correctly tags their items.

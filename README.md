# Just Gems

A material pack for [Silent Gear](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear) adding some main parts for various gemstones. This is intended for players who do not want to use Silent's Gems, but still want gem tools using **other gem mods**. Should be compatible with any gem mod that correctly tags their items.

Some things to note:

* **This does not add any blocks/items/ores.** Data packs are not capable of doing that. You must install a mod that adds gems supported by the data pack.
* If you see any **gems missing from this data pack**, please report it to me.
* If you find a mod that does not work with this data pack, they **may not be tagging their items correctly**. Ask the mod author or me to take a look.

This pack is licensed under The Unlicense. You may modify and distribute as you see fit, no need to credit me in any way (but it would be cool if you did).
